# NFL---Yards-Gained-vs.-Points-Scored
This project analyzes yards gained and points scored by NFL teams for the 2023 regular season.  I explored this project to see the correlation betweent the two variables, identify any teams that have discernible differences and what contributed to those differences.

My Findings:
I identified the Minnesota Vikings having the biggest gap in Yards Gained and Points Scored, where they rank 10th and 22nd, respectively.
My thesis was red zone scoring was a major factor in the Vikings being ranked so low in points, but high in yards.
I validated my thesis by ranking teams by Red Zone TD%, in which the Vikings ranked 28th.
